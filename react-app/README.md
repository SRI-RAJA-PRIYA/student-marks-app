# react-app (minimal scaffold)

This folder is a minimal scaffold added so tools that search for a React project folder (one that contains `package.json`) will find it.

What is included:
- `package.json` — minimal placeholder so folder is recognized as a JS project.
- `src/index.js` — tiny entry file (placeholder).
- `public/index.html` — minimal HTML file.

How to turn this into a real React app:
1. From this folder run `npm init` or `npx create-react-app .` to create a full React project.
2. Or manually add dependencies and a proper `start` script (for example, install `react`/`react-dom` and a bundler).

Quick commands (run these in Powershell from the `react-app` folder):

```powershell
cd react-app
# Create a full CRA app in this folder (recommended if you want a full app):
npx create-react-app .

# OR just install dependencies manually:
npm install react react-dom
# update package.json start script to a dev server of your choice
```

If your goal was only to satisfy a tool that expects a React project folder (i.e., a folder containing `package.json`), no further action is required.
